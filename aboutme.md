If you’ve come to this corner of the Owl About Omics website looking for the writer of these blogposts, you’ve come to the right place!

  My name is Vicky AuYeung, and I’m a PhD graduate at the University of Cambridge. I’m a biologist by training, and over the years I’ve gained firsthand experience and interest in using large biological datasets to study health and disease. Particularly with the rise of advanced technologies and big data, I believe it’s important for all of us to know how such data is collected, analysed, and interpreted to bring about changes in a healthcare setting.

When I'm not conducting research, I like to spend time writing, reading, and playing computer games with my plants, snails and pet snake...maybe not all at once, and not in that order.

**If you…**

1. Want a quick introduction to what omics is about and what it includes? Get started with the **Owl About Omics** tab.
2. Want some digestible reads on the latest omics-related research out there? Visit the **Hooting Research** page.
3. Are considering doing a PhD, or are merely curious about what the life of a PhD student is like? Mosey on to the **PhD Reflections** tab to read about my (humble) experience.

And finally, I’d love to hear from you! If you have any thoughts, comments, or questions please leave me a **_hoot_** on the relevant blogpost!
